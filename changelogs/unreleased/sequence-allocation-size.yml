title: Add support to custom entity sequence allocation size
type: feature
description: |
  Allows specifying custom allocation size for sequences used by entities. This can be useful for optimizing 
  performance.
  
  This allows to provide custom entity sequence allocation size in multiple ways:
  - From xml entity definition itself, using `allocationSize` attribute
  - Sequence specific configuration defined in application settings,
  `application.entity.sequence.%MY_SEQ%.allocation_size`
  - Global default allocation size : `application.entity.sequence.default_allocation_size`
  
  When `allocationSize` is 1, it forces Hibernate to execute a `SELECT nextval('seq')` query for every single entity 
  saved. Having an `allocationSize` greater than 1 is the performance tuner for database inserts. It controls how
  many IDs Hibernate fetches from the database in a single network call.
