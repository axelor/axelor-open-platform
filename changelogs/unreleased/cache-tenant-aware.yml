title: Implement tenant-aware AxelorCache
type: feature
description: |
  By default, when multi-tenancy is active, the cache automatically segregates entries based
  on the current tenant context.
  Use `CacheBuilder#nonTenantAware()` to disable this behavior and allow the cache
  to be shared globally across all tenants.
