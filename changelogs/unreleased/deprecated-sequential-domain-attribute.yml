title: The `sequential` attribute on `entity` definition is now deprecated
type: deprecate
description: |
  Since Hibernate 6.x, it creates a sequence per entity hierarchy instead of a single sequence `hibernate_sequence`.
  So the `sequential` attribute is no longer needed and should be removed from entity definitions. It is marked as 
  deprecated and will be removed in further version. All entities will now use their own sequence.
