title: Asynchronous Queue-Based Audit Tracking
type: enhancement
description: |
  Improved audit tracking with asynchronous queue-based processing to improve the performance.
  Now the listener performs a lightweight capture of raw data and inserts simple `AuditLog` rows into the database. The 
  main operation has no more complex logic executed, reducing the execution time. After the transaction commits, a 
  background thread picks up the AuditLog entries and handle the tracking process : generate the associated mail message 
  and emails sending.

  - Introduce `AuditLog` entity for persistent audit event storage with full state capture. It support retry logic 
  with max retries and error tracking.
  - For security and performance reasons, certain field types are automatically excluded from audit tracking : 
  passwords/encrypted/binary/collection and transient fields.
  - Tracking messages are not created immediately when a record is created/updated. Instead, they appear in the stream 
  after a brief delay.
  - Adaptive back-pressure mechanism controlled with following properties : 
  `application.audit.logs.flush-threshold`, `application.audit.processor.batch-delay`, 
  `application.audit.processor.activity-windows`, `application.audit.processor.busy-backoff-interval`, 
  `application.audit.processor.busy-backoff-max-retries` and `application.audit.processor.batch-size`.
