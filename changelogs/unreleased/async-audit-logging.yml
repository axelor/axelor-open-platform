type: enhancement
description: |
  Improved audit tracking with asynchronous queue-based processing to address performance issues:

  - Async audit queue to reduce blocking operations during entity changes
  - AuditLog model for persistent audit event storage with full state capture
  - Audit CLI command for managing and processing audit logs
  - Adaptive throttling in AuditProcessor for better resource management
  - Support to wait for audit queue to finish processing
  - Automatic cleanup of processed AuditLogs to reduce storage
