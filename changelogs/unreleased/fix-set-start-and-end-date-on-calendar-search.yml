title: Fetch calendar records based on visible range instead of current month
type: fix
description: |
  Previously, records were fetched based on the strict start and end of the current month. This caused missing data for 
  the trailing days of the previous month and leading days of the next month that were still visible. The fetch logic 
  now calculates the actual start and end dates of the visible viewport.
