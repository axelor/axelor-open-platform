title: Resolve generic type variables in inherited observer methods
type: fix
description: |
  When an observer method is declared in a generic base class (e.g. `onSave(@Observes SaveEvent<T>
  event)`), the event parameter type is now correctly resolved to the concrete type argument
  supplied by the subclass (e.g. `SaveEvent<Contact>` for `class ContactHandler extends
  GenericHandler<Contact>`).

  Previously, the unresolved type variable `T` was used for matching, causing generic observer
  methods to either never match or match too broadly.
