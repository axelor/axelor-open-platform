title: Fix files upload store
type: fix
description: |
  Ensures all stream are closed in order to avoid memory leak.
  S3 now upload files using stream-based uploads instead of file based upload as it costs a bit of extra I/O.
  S3 caching mechanism stores the entire file content in the Java Heap memory : this cause high memory consumption.
