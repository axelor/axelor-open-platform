title: Disable mass update depending on entity inheritance strategy
type: fix
description: |
  Depending on inheritance strategy defined on entities, bulk update may involve multiple tables. When it tries to update, 
  Hibernate tries to be smart and assigns "aliases" to manage the complexity. But PostgreSQL strictly forbids these 
  aliases in UPDATE statements and rejects the query generated by Hibernate with a syntax error `missing FROM-clause`.
  
  For that reason, mass update is now disabled depending on inheritance strategy. This is the case for `CLASS` (ie, 
  `TABLE_PER_CLASS`) and `JOINED` strategy. For `CLASS`, as soon as it has a child class, it is disabled. For `JOINED`,
  as soon as it has a subclass, it is disabled.

  Further versions aren't impacted. In Hibernate 6+, strategy for multi-table updates use Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
