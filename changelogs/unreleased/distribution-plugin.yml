title: Use Gradle distribution plugin
type: change
description: |
  In recent 8.0, we introduced a new task `buildApp` to build application distribution. Now we rely on built-in Gradle 
  distribution plugin. It provides `installDist` (replace `buildApp`) but also adds support to package content into ZIP 
  and TAR archives (ie `distZip` and `distTar`). CLI is still in BETA, so both tasks have been disabled by default. 
  Request the tasks explicitly to generate the archives.
