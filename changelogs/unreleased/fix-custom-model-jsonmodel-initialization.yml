title: Automatically initialize jsonModel field for custom model forms
type: fix
description: |
  When creating a new record in a custom model form view, the jsonModel field
  is now automatically set to match the view's jsonModel value.

  This ensures custom model records are properly initialized with the correct
  jsonModel identifier without requiring additional backend actions or manual
  intervention.
