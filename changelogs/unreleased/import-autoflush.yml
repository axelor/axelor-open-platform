title: Re-enable csv/xml imports auto flush after the record is managed
type: fix
description: |
  The import feature is used out of the box, so we re-introduce the explicit `flush()` call within the CSV/XML 
  processing loop immediately after the record is managed. This ensures that when the next record in the batch tries 
  to search for the previous one, the required data is present in the database. This accepts the reduced performance 
  (loss of JDBC batching) for the sake of functional correctness, which is the necessary default for an import utility.
