title: Fix handling of end-of-lines in i18n messages
type: fix
description: |
  CSV normalized end-of-lines to \r\n, between CSV records only, not for cell data.
  CSV cell data is now also normalized to \r\n.

  For multiline translation keys, need to normalize back to \n, as that's
  what is used in source code, meta views, etc.
  This fixes translations when keys contain end-of-lines.
