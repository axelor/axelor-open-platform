title: Make autocomplete search non-blocking to prevent keyboard input disruption
type: fix
description: |
  On M2O input autocomplete, as soon as search was triggered, onSelect then search query was triggered. onSelect is a 
  UI blocking action, so any subsequent keyboard input in that time is skipped causing a poor user experience on heavy 
  application.
  
  Now onSelect is triggered if necessary, means only if the context doesn't change. This reduce the number of calls.
  Moreover, keyboard input isn't blocking on input element anymore. This allow users to continue typing smoothly while 
  the onSelect action processes in the background.
  
  An abortion technique is implemented to abort previous search request depending on keyboard input received.
