title: Fix generating extended entities not included in project
type: fix
description: |
  Extended entities having a super class were wrongly generated in project : Entities in a 'SINGLE_TABLE' hierarchy 
  shouldn't be annotated with `@Table` (the root class declares the table mapping for the hierarchy). Issue only 
  happens with entities declared in module dependencies (project dependencies not concerned).
