title: Fix redundant dashlet refresh after grid initialization
type: fix
description: |
  Previously, when a dashlet was not yet rendered (e.g., in an inactive panel tab or hidden state) and refresh: true was set through action-attrs, it would trigger an unnecessary refresh once it became visible.
  This fix ensures that if the dashlet has already been refreshed during grid initialization, the extra refresh triggered by the earlier refresh: true flag is skipped.
