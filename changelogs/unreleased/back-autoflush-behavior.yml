title: Restore flush on JPA.persist and JPA.merge
type: feature
description: |
  In previous version, we removed automatic flush calls from JPA.persist() and JPA.merge() methods to restore JDBC 
  batching for bulk operations.
  We restored this behavior to ensure backward compatibilities. It was initially added for an eager synchronization model 
  (assume read-your-own-writes consistency immediately after any `persist` or `merge`) but also to reduced cognitive 
  load (doesn't have to wired about potential synchronization issues). We thought the impact will be restricted, but 
  the fact is that lot of process depending the behavior. This requires more preparation and details before we can get 
  ride of this anti-pattern strategy and fit on standard.
