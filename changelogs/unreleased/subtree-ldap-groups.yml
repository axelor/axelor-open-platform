title: Add LDAP support to subtree search for groups
type: feature
description: |
  By default, search scope to locate groups is `onlevel`: only the level immediately below the base DN. Use new 
  property `auth.ldap.group.search.subtree = true | false`, to update the search scope to `subtree` if needed (search 
  subtree below the base DN and includes the base DN level).
