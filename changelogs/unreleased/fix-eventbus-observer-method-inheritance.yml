title: Support observer method inheritance in EventBus
type: fix
description: |
  Observer methods are now inherited by subclasses, as required by the CDI specification.
  Previously, only methods declared directly on the bound class were discovered; inherited
  observer methods were silently ignored.

  Overriding rules are also respected: if a subclass overrides an observer method, only the
  overriding version is invoked (the parent version is suppressed), matching standard Java
  method override semantics.
