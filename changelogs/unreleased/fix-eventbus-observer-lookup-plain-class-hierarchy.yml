title: Fix observer lookup for plain class event hierarchies
type: fix
description: |
  Observers whose event parameter is a supertype are now correctly invoked when a subtype event
  is fired. For example, an observer declared as `onModel(@Observes ModelEvent e)` is now
  triggered when a `ContactEvent extends ModelEvent` is fired, as required by the CDI
  specification.

  Previously, observer lookup used an exact class match, so supertype observers were never
  notified for subtype events.
