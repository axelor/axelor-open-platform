title: Add LDAP support to subtree search for users
type: feature
description: |
  By default, search scope to locate users is `onelevel`: search only only level immediately below the base DN. Use new 
  property `auth.ldap.user.search.subtree = true | false`, to update the search scope to `subtree` if needed 
  (search whole subtree of base DN).
