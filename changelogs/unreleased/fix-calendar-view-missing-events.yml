title: Fix lost action-view context in calendar views
type: fix
description: |
  Calendar views with context-based domains (e.g. `self.user.id = :_userId`) displayed
  no events because the calendar widget's `_domainContext` overwrote the action-view's
  context variables during filter merge. The DataStore's original context is now preserved
  by spreading it first when building the calendar's domain context.
