title: Don't show automatic attrs on form view when there is at least one manual custom field
type: fix
description: |
  Don't show automatic attrs on form view when there is at least one manual custom field,
  e.g. `<field name="attrs.customField" />`
  Static widgets on grid view (like `button`) do not prevent automatic attrs.
