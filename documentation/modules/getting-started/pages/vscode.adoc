From the vscode, open the project folder using menu:File[Open Folder].

== Debug

Run the following task to generate a `Run` launcher:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew generateLauncher
----

This will generate `.vscode/launch.json`.
Switch to "Run and Debug" kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+D] panel
and debug with the `Run` task.

Whenever the sources are changed, re-run following task:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew classes
----

This task will re-compile updated classes and the debugger
will try to hot reload the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* repeat `./gradlew generateCode` whenever you add/change any domain model definitions
* repeat `./gradlew generateLauncher` if you run gradle clean task or delete build directory
