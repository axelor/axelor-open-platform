:toc-title:

In this chapter we will see the object views. The object views are xml definitions
about the user interface to represent the object models to the end users.

The {page-component-title} support several kind of views for an object. This includes:

* xref:views/grid.adoc[Grid] - shows the data list in as columns
* xref:views/form.adoc[Form] - shows a single record in a form layout
* xref:views/tree.adoc[Tree] - shows data in hierarchical manner
* xref:views/charts.adoc[Chart] - shows data as 2D graphs
* xref:views/calendar.adoc[Calendar] - shows data in schedule like view
* xref:views/kanban.adoc[Kanban] - shows data as agile kanban board
* xref:views/cards.adoc[Cards] - shows data list as cards
* xref:views/custom.adoc[Custom] - shows data using custom templates
* xref:views/gantt.adoc[Gantt] - shows data using a Gantt chart
* xref:views/search.adoc[Search] - shows multi-object search view

The xref:views/grid.adoc[Grid] & xref:views/form.adoc[Form] views are the main views. If these
views are not provided for model, a set of default views are generated automatically.
However, they may not produce good-looking interface, it's always advised to
provide views for domain models.

Like the object models, views are also defined using xml format.

Each file should have proper declaration:
