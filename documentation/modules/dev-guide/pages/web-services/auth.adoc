= Auth Services
:toc:
:toc-title:

For the moment, web services uses session based authentication. So the client
application must keep track of session id and cookies between requests.

The session can be established with login services:

== Login

.Request
----
POST /login.jsp HTTP/1.1
----

.Header
----
Content-Type: application/json
----

.Body
[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password" : "secret"
}
----

The authentication data is sent in the body of the request.

Returns response with HTTP status `200` if login success otherwise returns
HTTP status `401`.

Only relevent headers and request body is shown.

== Logout

.Request
[source]
----
GET /logout HTTP/1.1
----

The login response returns session cookies which should be tracked by client
application.

Some of the libraries that can keep track of sessions:

* http://requests.ryanmccue.info/[Request for PHP]
* http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/[Request for Python]
* https://github.com/request/request[Request for NodeJS]
* http://hc.apache.org/[Apache HTTP Client (Java)]
