= Internationalization
:toc:
:toc-title:

Internationalization, often referred to as i18n, is a very important feature
of any business application in today's globalized economy.

The {page-component-title} provides a very efficient way to make your application multilingual.

== Translations

Unlike the standard Java practice to provide translations catalogs with
properties files, the translations are stored in separate CSV files for each language.
This is because the {page-component-title} stores and loads translations from database
to allow live update of translations by end-users.

The structure of the translation files in an Axelor module looks like this:

-----
src/main/resources/i18n/messages.csv
src/main/resources/i18n/messages_en.csv
src/main/resources/i18n/messages_fr.csv
-----

The `messages.csv` is the template from which we have to create language specific
`messages_<language>.csv` files. The template should not be updated manually as
it's automatically generated using the string extraction utility.

The language part in the filename should follow the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646[IETF BCP 47 language tag] standard (eg. `en`, `en-US`, `fr`, `fr-CA`). The language tags are case insensitive, but it is recommended to use the canonical form (eg. `en-US` instead of `en-us`). Once loaded into the database, the language tags are normalized to the canonical form.

The following Gradle task can be used to extract and update message files:

[source,sh]
----
  $ ./gradlew i18n [--with-context] [--languages <comma-separated language tags>]
----

By default, initial messages files are generated for `en` and `fr` languages.
Use the `--languages` option to generate messages for additional languages.

The CSV files have four columns:

* `key` - the original string
* `message` - the translated string
* `comment` - some comments for/by language translator
* `context` - a list of file names with line numbers where the text can be found

The `context` column is populated only if `--with-context` option is used.

The translation messages are imported in database during the db initialization.
The corresponding database table only stores `key` and `message`.

The key is original text extracted from the Java, Groovy or XML files. In case
of fields where title is not given, the field name is automatically converted to
human-readable form.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="Contact">
  ...
  <string name="fullName" help="true" />
  ...
</entity>
-----

In this case, as there is no title given, a human-readable text `Full name` is
generated and used as key. Also, the `help="true"` is used to automatically
generate key for help attribute. The format of auto generate help key is
`help:<entity>.<field>` so in this case a key `help:Contact.fullName` is
generated.

The context is a list of file name + line number where the key is found:

-----
main/resources/domains/Contact.xml:100
main/resources/domains/Contact.xml:150
main/java/com/axelor/contact/controller/HelloController.java:57
-----

It means the key is found in those files on the given line. This allows
translators to locate the text and understand the context to provide correct
translation or suggest changes in case of conflicting meanings. In that case, we
can choose to use some logical non-human readable keys and provide readable text
from the translation.

Because of the context column being a multiline value, it's difficult to edit
the CSV files in plain text editors. So always prefer editing with some
spreadsheet editors (Excel or LibreOffice).

== Supported Languages

Default supported languages are `en` and `fr`. To add more languages, you need to enrich the `select.language` selection.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
  <!-- This adds options to the default language selection of "en", "fr" -->
  <selection name="select.language" id="select.language.extra">
    <option value="en-US">English (United States)</option>
    <option value="en-GB">English (United Kingdom)</option>
    <option value="fr-CA">French (Canada)</option>
  </selection>
----

== Strings

The string values from XML sources don't require any special treatment, but
translatable strings in you code must be wrapped with a special method `I18n.get(...)`.

The `I18n` is defined under `com.axelor.i18n` package and provides static
methods to get translations and custom ResourceBundle which can be used with
standard Java translation API.

[source,java]
-----
// get the translation for the given text
I18n.get("Full name");

// get the translation for the given key
I18n.get("so.customer.title");

// get singular or plural translation based on the given number
I18n.get("{0} record selected.", "{0} records selected.", selected.size());
-----

The `I18n.get` only works when JPA context is started as the translation is
loaded from the database table (which is imported from the CSV files during
database initialization).

So the `I18n.get` should not be called if the code is executed before the
JPA context is initialized (like static variables).

== Translation Fallback

There is a translation fallback mechanism that ensures that if an exact match for a translation is not found, the translation for the primary language is used instead. This is particularly useful for avoiding duplicate translation effort for languages with regional variations, as well as for maintaining a consistent user experience even when some translations are missing.

For example, if a user selects `fr-CA` (Canadian French) as their language and a specific translation is not available in `messages_fr-CA.csv`, the translation will fall back to `messages_fr.csv` (French). If the translation is still not found, original translation key is used, which is typically the message for the default language, `en` (English).

This fallback mechanism is used in translated messages, as well as in translated search results.

== Value Translation

The value translation feature allows to translate record values.

[source,xml]
----
<entity name="Product">
  <string name="name" translatable="true" /> <1>
  ...
</entity>
----
<1> the field is marked as translatable

The value translations are stored with key in `value:<value>` format. For example, `value:Laptop` or
`value:Hard Disk` etc.

The field values can be translated by clicking on a flag icon visible on that field:

.Translate icon
image::translation-icon.png[]

The translation dialog looks like this:

.Translation dialog
