In this chapter we will see one of the main component of the modules, the domain objects.

The domain objects, also called models or entities are nothing but a representation
of data in object form used by the modules.

The domain objects are JPA pojo classes. The {page-component-title} uses
{url-hibernate}[Hibernate] as the JPA provider.

The domain objects are defined using XML in the `src/main/resources/domains`
folder. The definition is then used by code generator to generate entity and
repository classes.

The generated entity classes are JPA compatible pojo classes with some added
features to deal with collection fields & computed fields.

The generated repository classes provides methods for CRUD operations and some
finder methods. The repository class generation is configurable, we'll see
about this very soon.
