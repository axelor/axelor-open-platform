= Custom Fields
:toc:
:toc-title:

Starting from {page-component-title} v5, we can now add custom fields to the domain models
dynamically at runtime.

== Models

Custom fields are implemented using `JSON` data type support from underlying database.
All the three officially supported databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle) are supported.

A domain model (entity) can have custom fields if it has either `jsonAttr="true"`
attribute defined or has a `string` field with `json="true"`.

Here are some examples:

[source,xml]
----
<entity name="Product" jsonAttr="true">
  <string name="name" required="true" unique="true" min="2" />
  ...
</entity>
----

or

[source,xml]
----
<entity name="Product">
  <string name="name" required="true" unique="true" min="2" />
  ...
  <string name="attrs" title="Attributes" json="true" />
</entity>
----

If we provide `jsonAttr="true"`, which is default, a field `string` field
named `"attrs"` is automatically generated in entity class which is same
as second example.

IMPORTANT: The field name `attrs` is now reserved for defining json field to store custom field values.

We can also define multiple json fields in domain model:

[source,xml]
----
<entity name="Contact">
  <string name="name" required="true" unique="true" min="2" />
  ...
  <string name="customAttrs" title="Custom Attributes" json="true" />
  <string name="extraAttrs" title="Extra Attributes" json="true" />
</entity>
----

== Views

If the entity has `attrs` field, the `form` and `grid` views can show custom fields automatically.
Otherwise, for differently named json fields, we have to include those fields in view:

[source,xml]
----
<form ...>
  ...
  <panel title="Attributes">
    <field name="attrs" colSpan="12" />
  </panel>
</form>
----

All custom fields defined for the given json field will be visible inside this panel widget. However,
visibility in grid view is controlled by `Show in grid` flag which we will see in next section.

== Define fields

The custom fields are defined dynamically at runtime using graphical interface.
All defined fields are accessible from menu:Administration[Model Management > Custom Fields].

The image bellow shows the grid view listing all the defined custom fields:

.Custom Fields (grid)

The image bellow shows the form view to create/edit custom fields:

.Custom Fields (form)

=== Properties

The custom fields are saved as `com.axelor.meta.db.MetaJsonField` records. Following fields are defined:

== Predefined fields

Sometimes we may have to predefine few custom fields. This can be done with data import feature.
Here is an example data import rules and input format:

.Input data
[source,xml]
----
<custom-fields for="com.axelor.sale.db.Product" on="attrs">
  <field name="color" selection="product.color.selection" />
  <field name="active" type="boolean" />
  <field name="price" type="decimal" />
  <field name="quantity" type="integer" />
  <field name="date" type="datetime" />
  <field name="seller" type="many-to-one" target="com.axelor.contact.db.Contact" />
</custom-fields>
----

.Import config
[source,xml]
----
<bind node="custom-fields/field" type="com.axelor.meta.db.MetaJsonField"
  search="self.name = :name AND self.model = :model AND self.modelField = :modelField">
  <bind node="../@for" to="model" />
  <bind node="../@on" to="modelField" />
  <bind node="@name" to="name" />
  <bind node="@type" to="type" eval="type?:'string'" />
  <bind node="@target" to="targetModel" />
  <bind node="@selection" to="selection" />
  <bind node="@widget" to="widget" />
</bind>
----

== Context-aware fields

Custom fields can be context aware, means they can be shown/hidden depending on the value
of some `ManyToOne` field of current record.

For example, if we have defined a custom field `color` for `Product` model and if `Product`
model has a `ManyToOne` field `category`, we can make `color` field contextual by setting:

- `contextField (Value if)` to `category`
- `contextFieldValue (Value)` to desired `category` value (e.g. `Computer`)

The `color` field is now contextual and will become visible only if product category is `Computer`.

== Context-aware search

In advanced search, the contextual fields can be used to search on specific context value.
If searched with context a value, corresponding contextual fields will become visible in grid view.

Following image shows a context field selection in top section of the advanced search popup.

.Contextual Advance Search
image::contextual-search-popup.png[]

Following image shows the contextual search result. You can see the `Color` column becomes visible:

== JPQL Functions

JPQL functions can be used to extract and set values in custom fields:

[cols="4,8"]
|===
| Function | Description

| `json_extract(jsonField, path…)`
`json_extract_text(jsonField, path…)`
| extract a String from specified JSON field

| `json_extract_integer(jsonField, path…)`
| extract an Integer from specified JSON field

| `json_extract_decimal(jsonField, path…)`
| extract a BigDecimal from specified JSON field

| `json_extract_boolean(jsonField, path…)`
| extract a Boolean from specified JSON field

| `json_set(jsonField, path, value)`
| set value in specified JSON field
|===

Example:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE
  Product p
SET
  p.attrs = json_set(p.attrs, 'seller.name', :value)
WHERE
  json_extract_integer(p.attrs, 'seller', 'id') = 1
