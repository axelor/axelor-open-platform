= Step 4: Define Views
:toc:
:toc-title:

Now we have some models defined, it's time to define views for them.

== Define views

The {page-component-title} uses xml definition to define the views. In this section,
we'll see how to create `grid` and `form` views for the `Contact` model:

[source,xml]
.axelor-contact/src/main/resources/views/Contact.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<object-views xmlns="http://axelor.com/xml/ns/object-views"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://axelor.com/xml/ns/object-views
  https://axelor.com/xml/ns/object-views/object-views_7.4.xsd">

  <grid name="contact-grid"
        title="Contacts"
        model="com.axelor.contact.db.Contact"> <1>
    <field name="fullName" />
    <field name="email" />
    <field name="phone" />
    <field name="dateOfBirth" />
  </grid>

  <form name="contact-form"
        title="Contact"
        model="com.axelor.contact.db.Contact"> <2>
    <panel name="overviewPanel" title="Overview"> <3>
      <field name="fullName" readonly="false">
        <editor> <4>
          <field name="title" colSpan="3"/>
          <field name="firstName" colSpan="4"/>
          <field name="lastName" colSpan="5"/>
        </editor>
      </field>
      <field name="dateOfBirth" />
      <field name="email">
        <viewer><![CDATA[ <5>
          <>
            <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a>
          </>
        ]]></viewer>
      </field>
      <field name="phone">
        <viewer><![CDATA[
          <>
            <a href={`tel:${phone}`}>{phone}</a>
          </>
        ]]></viewer>
      </field>
    </panel>
    <panel name="aboutMePanel" title="About me">
        <field name="notes" showTitle="false" colSpan="12"/>
    </panel>
    <panel-related name="addressesPanel
                   field="addresses" <6>
                   form-view="address-form-popup"> <7>
        <field name="street"/>
        <field name="area"/>
        <field name="city"/>
        <field name="state"/>
        <field name="zip"/>
        <field name="country"/>
    </panel-related>
    <panel name="sidePanel" sidebar="true"> <8>
      <field name="createdOn"/>
      <field name="createdBy"/>
      <field name="updatedOn"/>
      <field name="updatedBy"/>
    </panel>
  </form>

  <form name="address-form-popup"
        title="Address"
        model="com.axelor.contact.db.Address">
    <panel title="Overview">
      <field name="street" />
      <field name="area" />
      <field name="city" />
      <field name="zip" />
      <field name="state" />
      <field name="country" />
    </panel>
  </form>

</object-views>
----
<1> The grid view with the give fields are grid columns
<2> The form view is used to view/edit a record
<3> The panel that can be used to group relevant fields
<4> The editor can be used to define custom editor for the field
<5> The viewer can be used to define custom template to display field value
<6> The panel-related can be used to show o2m/m2m fields
<7> The form view to edit the address in popup
<8> The panel to show in the right sidebar

Views are generally mapped to some domain object, here the `grid` and `form`
view are defined for the `Contact` object.

The view definition is minimal and you only have to define layout of fields.
The fields defined in the view binds to the object fields, if a corresponding
field doesn't exist in the object it's considered as dummy field and values
from dummy fields has to be handled manually.

Let's see these views in some more details:

== Grid  view

The grid view is used to show the record list. Grid view has following properties:

* `name` - unique name of the view
* `model` - fully qualified model name
* `editable` - whether the grid is editable
* `orderBy` - order by the given field

An `editable` grid allows to update records inline. This can be used for quick
data updates.

Grid view has some advanced features, like grouping, row/cell highlight, buttons etc.

== Form View

The form view is used to show/edit a single record. This is the most important
view for an object and provide rich set of widgets.

Form view has the following properties:

* `name` - unique name of the view
* `model` - fully qualified model name
* `editable` - whether the form is editable
* `onNew` - action to execute when creating new record
* `onLoad` - action to execute when loading a record
* `onSave` - action to execute when saving the record

The form uses responsive layout that adjusts according to the available screen size.
The form is divided into 12 columns. The first 8 columns are used to place the normal
`panel` and `panel-related` panels and the rest 4 columns are used to place the
`sidebar` panels. If sidebar panels are not provided the normal panels will occupy
all the 12 columns.

Let's see each type of panel.

* `panel` - panel with 12 columns, generally used to put simple fields
* `panel-related` - a panel to put o2m/m2m fields
* `panel-tabs` - holds another panels which are shown as notebook tabs
* `panel-include` - include another panel form
* `panel-dashlet` - dashlet panel can be used to embed another views

The `panel` can use following widgets:

* `field` - binds a model field, automatically selects appropriate widget
* `spacer` - can be used to skip a cell
* `label` - can be used to set a static label
* `button` - a button widget that executes some action
* `button-group` - group of buttons
* `panel` - nested panel to fine tune the layout, with `stacked="true"` the contents
   can be stacked vertically (useful when showing widgets using `showIf/hideIf` expressions or by other means)

The field has few properties, but most common of them are:

* `name` - name of the widget
* `hidden` - whether the widget is hidden
* `readonly` - whether the widget is readonly
* `required` - whether the field is required

Form view also supports some advanced features like dynamic expressions.
See the xref:dev-guide:index.adoc[Developer Guide] for more details.

== Update views

If you change the view xml file, you have to re-import the views in database. Use the button:[Restore All...]
on menu:Administration[View Management > All Views] to re-import all the views.

CAUTION: All the changes applied directly to views in the database (through web ui) will be lost

In this chapter we seen how to define views. In the xref:step5.adoc[next chapter]
we will see how to create actions and menu items.
